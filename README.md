# Task Manager App

This is a full-stack Task Manager application built with **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** (Express) for the backend, and **MySQL** for the database. It allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main folders:

- `frontend`: Contains the React application for the frontend.
- `backend`: Contains the Node.js (Express) server and API for the backend.

## Features

- Add, edit, delete, and filter tasks.
- Task management with statuses (e.g., completed, pending).
- Full-stack architecture with React and Node.js.
